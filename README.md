# Advanced_HTML

## Objective:

Expand upon your Week 2 assignment by integrating the advanced HTML topics covered in Week 3. Feel free to refine and modify any part of your previous assignment as you see fit.

### Tasks:

1. **Contact Form**:
    - Add a section to your page for visitors to contact you.
    - Design a simple form with fields for name, email, and a message.
    - Use appropriate input types and include a submit button.
2. **Table of Interests**:
    - Create a table listing some of your favorite books, movies, or hobbies.
    - Include columns for the name, category, and a brief description or rating.
3. **Media Showcase**:
    - Embed a video or audio clip that you find interesting or inspiring. This
    could be a tech talk, a favorite song, or any relevant content.
    - Ensure the media elements have controls for play, pause, and volume.
4. **SVG Graphics**:
    - Design or find an SVG graphic that you like and add it to your page. This
    could be a decorative element or something related to your interests.
5. **Semantic Structure**:
    - Review your page structure and ensure you're using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` where appropriate.
6. **HTML Meta Tags**:
    - If you haven't already, add relevant meta tags to your document for
    viewport settings, character encoding, and a brief description of the
    page.
7. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
    - Implement ARIA roles and properties where needed, especially if you have navigation or interactive elements.

### Submission:

- Create an index.html file
- Upload the file to Git Classroom before the deadline.
- Ensure that your code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability.

### Bonus:

Figure out how to use your code from your HTML Fundamentals repo without using copy (ctrl-C) and paste (ctrl-V)


**This is an opportunity to not only apply what you've learned but also to refine and improve upon your previous work. Good luck!**
